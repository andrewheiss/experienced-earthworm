## Abstract

A growing body of research currently demonstrates that state membership
in authoritarian-dominated regional and international organizations (ROs
and IOs) can weaken the prospects for political liberalization and can
serve to bolster autocratic regime stability. Concurrently, over the
past decade, the regulatory environment for nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs) has become increasingly restricted, particularly in
authoritarian regimes where autocrats wield anti-civil society
regulations in order to maintain and increase regime stability. NGOs
play an important role in international policymaking, often holding
consultative or voting roles in various types of IOs. Given the
increasing restriction of civil society in authoritarian states, what
role do NGOs play in authoritarian-oriented IOs? In this paper, I
explore two questions related to authoritarian stability, civil society,
and international organizations: (1) how does membership in
authoritarian IOs shape states’ domestic civil society regulations and
NGO behavior, and (2) how does NGO participation in IO deliberations
differ from that in democratic-oriented IOs? I explore these questions
with cross-national quantitative data from the Varieties of Democracy
project and two qualitative case studies of NGOs working with
authoritarian IOs.

### 🧙🪱: Note on “experienced earthworm” project name

Because project titles change all the time with revisions, rewriting,
and peer review, we used [{codename}](http://svmiller.com/codename/) to
generate an Ubuntu-style internal-to-me project name that won’t change.

``` r
library(codename)
codename_message()
#> code name generated by {codename} v.0.5.0. R version 4.3.0 (2023-04-21).

codename(type = "ubuntu", seed = "authn IOs and NGOs")
#> [1] "experienced earthworm"
```
